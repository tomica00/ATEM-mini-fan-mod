# ATEM Mini Pro ISO fan mod
Easy hack for ATEM mini switchers to make the fan always run at max speed.

All you need to do is cut the blue and the yellow wire from the fan connector.

## Tools

You need a T10 torx screwdriver.

## Instructions

1. Remove the 4 screws that are located under the rubber pads, in the corners.

2. Remove the center screw under the black label that says "Blackmagicdesign".

3. Carefully release the case clips by sliding a guitar pick along the edge.

4. Carefully open the case, from the taller (thicker) side. There is a flex cable on the thinner side.

5. Unplug the fan cable.

6. Cut the blue and the yellow wire or if you don't want to cut it, remove the pins from the connector by lifting the tiny plastic tongues.

7. Isolate each wire with heatshrink or tape.

8. Put everything together

You should now hear the fan run at maximum speed!
